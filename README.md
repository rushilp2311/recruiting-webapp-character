 ### 2hr-Mark
 Explanation from the submission email : 
```I had a small hiccup. I accidentally accepted the invite before reading the other email from my recruiter at around 5:15 pm today. Then 30-40 minutes later, I opened the email realizing that I shouldn't have accepted the invitation until I start the exercise, which I planned to do over the weekend. But anyway, in whatever time was left I finished what I could. I have created a branch called 2hr-mark to show that progress. I will continue to work on this over the weekend but all the work I can do in the remaining 1hr is merged through that branch.```

### extra-1hr
  I took one more hour to compensate the time loss. I have finished few things in this branch.


Let me know if you need anything else.
